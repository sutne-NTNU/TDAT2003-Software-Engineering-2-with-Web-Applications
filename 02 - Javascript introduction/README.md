# Javascript introduction

This assignment is an intro to javascript, while also demonstrates how you can send data to, and receieve data,
from an api. Unfortunately the [api](http://bigdata.stud.iie.ntnu.no/sentiment/webresources/sentiment/log?api-key=Happy!!!)
we were given for this specific assignment is no longer available. It was designed to give a number representing the mood
of a word/sentence you send to it, and the website would change colour based on that value.

I have later changed it to just give a value based on the length of the word instead.
